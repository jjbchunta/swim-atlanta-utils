# Setup

I didn't feel like making these executable files or adding a GUI, so, we're gonna do this the way god intended.

Install the node package manager if you haven't already, and preform this command while within the project's top directory:

```
npm install
```

# Scripts

Broadly speaking, running any of these scripts involve this command template:

```
node bin/[File Handle].js [Absolute Path To .csv Data]
```
